Three main observations are:
1. Treatment regimens with Capomulin and Ramicane seem very efficient as they correspond to lower tumor volumes
2. It is clear that tumor volumes decrease with timepoints which is indicative of treatment success
3. There is clear correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume (correlation coefficent of 0.95), which demonstrates that heavier mice develop larger tumor volumes
4. There are very few (barely one) outlier across four of the treatment regimens, which suggests the data are reliable
